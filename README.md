# GECX QA Evals

**Automated quality assurance for Google Cloud Conversational Agents — built so your team catches a broken
agent before your customers do.**

---

## The problem

Conversational agents drift. An instruction gets tweaked, a tool gets updated, a routing rule changes — and
somewhere in that change, a behavior your customers rely on quietly breaks. Manual QA catches some of it,
eventually, after someone notices. By then it's already shipped.

## What this gives you

A standing QA layer that runs real, live conversations against your deployed agent — the same way a customer
would talk to it — and tells you exactly what changed, what broke, and what still works. Every time.

- **Regression testing that actually talks to your agent.** Not canned transcripts, not mocked responses —
  live simulated conversations against your real deployed agent, scored on whether it *behaved* correctly.
- **Instruction changes never slip through unnoticed.** The moment an agent's instructions change, you know —
  before you've run a single test.
- **A findings trail your team can trust.** Every run leaves a clear record: what passed, what regressed,
  what's still open — not just a pass/fail number that resets every time.

- **Real performance data, not estimates.** Token usage, latency, and conversation replay links straight from
  the platform.
- **One report, ready to share.** A clean, self-contained page with the results, built to forward to a
  teammate or a stakeholder without any setup on their end.
  → [See a sample report](examples/sample-qa-report.html) (download and open in a browser — sample data only).
- **Scales with your org.** One agent or an entire app, one person or a distributed team syncing results
  through your own source control — no extra infrastructure required.
- **Self-contained on SCRAPI alone.** No AI subscription required — the whole pipeline runs end to end on
  SCRAPI's own engine. Have Claude access? That's a bonus: layer in AI assistance for writing new test
  cases, spotting coverage gaps, and diagnosing failures, whenever you want it.

## What a run leaves behind

Every run adds a dated entry to your findings log, newest on top. This is a trimmed excerpt of one
(sample data) — [the full log is here](examples/sample-findings.md):

> **Status:** ⚠️ Ran 2026-10-06 14:30 PDT (17:30 EDT) — 4/6 passed; 2 fail(s): `billing_switch_to_autopay`,
> `billing_change_due_date`.
>
> **Drift:** ⚠️ instructions changed since the baseline — a failure below may be a stale test rather than an
> agent bug.
>
> #### Changed since last run
> - **Pass rate:** 4/6 → 4/6 (no change)
> - **Fixed (now passing):** billing_dispute_charge
> - **Regressed (newly failing):** billing_change_due_date
> - **Still failing:** billing_switch_to_autopay
>
> #### What failed
> - **billing_switch_to_autopay** · 3 turns · conversation ID included to replay it
>   - *Expected:* the bot reads back the billing cycle date before enrolling autopay.
>   - *What happened:* the bot enrolled autopay without reading back the cycle date confirmation.

Two things you don't get from a plain pass/fail number: what *changed* since last time, and a heads-up when
the agent's own instructions moved underneath your tests.

## Built for GECX

Purpose-built for agents on Google Cloud's Conversational Agents platform. Drop it into a project, point it
at your deployed agent, and it's ready to run.

Fully integrated with **cxas-scrapi**, Google Cloud's own open-source evaluation framework — every
conversation is run and scored through it, and every performance number is pulled straight from it. Same
engine, same data, as the platform team's own tooling.
